Code:
rows = int(input("Enter the row size for the pattern: "))
for i in range(rows, 0, -1):  # Outer loop for rows in reverse
    for j in range(1, i + 1):  # Inner loop for columns
        print("*", end=" ")   # Print star
    print()

Output:
Enter the row size for the pattern: 5
* * * * * 
* * * * 
* * * 
* * 
* 

Code Explanation:
We take input for the number of rows to create a reverse star pattern.

The outer loop starts from the given row size and decreases, while the inner loop prints stars equal to the row number.

Using end=" " keeps stars on the same line, and print() moves to the next row.
